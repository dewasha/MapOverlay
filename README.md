# MapOverlay
This asset is to make an overlay of a map to be able to build roads in Unreal Engine.
Because changing the Landscape Material all the time is annoying. So I made this asset to make an overlay map, check this tutorial to know how to import the map:

# Setup
- To use it download this repository and put it in your project folder, open unreal and drag the blueprint to the level.
- After that click on the blueprint and select the Landscape, and click Adjust to Landscape (keep in mind that it is in development, so it can't work very well). The box will be adjusted to the landscape.
- Now import the texture from the map by dragging it, and then increase the opacity, and that's it!
